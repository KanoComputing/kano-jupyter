##Kano Jupyter

This repository integrates Jupyter Notebook on Kano OS. At this stage this is a PoC which covers the basics of:

 * Installing the Jupyter framework on the system
 * Provides a Classic Mode icon to launch a sample Jupyter Notebook
 * Adds an entry to start Jupyter from the Dashboard
 * Provides a debian package which unfolds all of the above

##Current Limitations

This is a work in progress:

 * Browser opens an extra tab - unrelated to Jupyter
 * Dashboard icon is missing, but it still opens the app and works
 * Browser should start maximized
 * No default sample Notebook available yet
