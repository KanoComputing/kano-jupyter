## Kano Jupyter

This repository integrates Jupyter Notebook on Kano OS. At this stage this is a PoC which covers the basics of:

 * Installing the Jupyter framework on the system
 * Adds 3 icons on the Dashboard to launch several tutorials
 * Integrates the OpenCV libray with webcam support
 * Provides a debian package which unfolds all of the above
