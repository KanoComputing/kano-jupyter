These questions are answered by doing comparisons (<, >, <=, >=, ==. !=)\n\nThese comparisons are the following: \n\n`>   greater than `\n\n`<   less than `\n\n`>=  greater than or equal to `\n\n`<=  less than or equal to `\n\n`==  equal `\n\n`!=  not equal `\n\n\nFor example: you walk into a room and need to decide if the lights are off and you need to turn them on. \n\n**if** the lights are off when you enter a room, **turn them on**\n\n**else**, walk into the room with the lights already on \n\nIn the above example we are checking to see if **lights on** is true or false \n\nIf lights equal (==) off, turn them on \n\nIf lights do not equal (!= )off. walk into the room "
