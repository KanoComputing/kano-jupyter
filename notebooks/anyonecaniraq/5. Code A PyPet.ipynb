Today we are going to code our own PyPet or Python Pet! \n\nTo make our cute pet we will use variables and ASCII art to make it come to life! \n\nFor this example we will code all of our variables and then at the end we will display it! You can decide what type of pet you want so feel free to type your own information in! \n\nWe will use ASCII art to visualize our pet. ASCII art is created by using the letters, numbers, and other characters on the keyboard. \n\nBelow are some of the pets you could code: \n\ncat: (=^o.o^=)__\n\nmouse: <:3 )---\n\nfish: <`)))><\n\ndog: (U .x. U)"
