Many times when you use a computer it is checking to see if something is true or false. \n\nLet's use the example of a game. Say your player has low energy and needs food to get energy back. You may check what items you have. \n\nIf you **have food**, your computer will report back to you that you having food is **TRUE**, you can feed the player and continue the game.\n\nIf you **DO NOT have food**, your computer will report back to you that you having food is **FALSE**, you can not feed your player and you must take a rest to regain energy\n\nLet's look at a basicexample below. We are going to print some code and ask the conputer questions with code:\n\n**`.islower()`** will let us know if the letters in a word are lowercase\n\n**`.isupper()`** will let us know if the letters in a word are uppercase"
