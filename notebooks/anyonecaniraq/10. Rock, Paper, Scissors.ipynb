Create a list of choices \n2. Create if, elif, and else statements to determine HOW to win\n3. Create a way to get user input to play the game\n\nAs a reminder, when you play rock, paper, scissors, there are very specific ways to win. \n\nRock crushes scissors. Scissors cut paper. Paper covers rock. If you have the same thing (rock and rock) it is a tie! \n\nBelow, you will have some completed code for one of the above scenarios (if the player picks rock). You will have to code the two other scenarios (paper and scissors). "
