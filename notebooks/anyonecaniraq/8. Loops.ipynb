We can use a loop to help us! \n\nLoops are a way to run the same code over, and over until we tell the program to stop. We have a lot of different loops. \n\n- You can run a loop a certain amount of times\n- You can run a loop for a certain amount of time (seconds, minutes, hours)\n- You can run a loop while you wait for something else to happen (exiting a game)\n- You can run a loop when something happens (start a loop if you move to another level)\n\nThere are a ton of options! \n\nFor this course we will focus on two types of loops. A **for** and **while** loop. \n\nA for loop can be used, when you want something to happen FOR a specific amount of time. \n"

Instead, I could use a for loop to print it five times and not have to type print(\"hello\") each time: \n\nfor i in range (5): \n    print(\"hello\")\n    \nIn the above example we say use the letter i. You can use any letter, as it is a a variable that is counting the number of times something is happening, in the above example 5 times. You can think of it collecting tally marks for how many times something happens\n\nEssentially, the program runs the coode, print \"hello\", and it will check the counter to make sure it is only running the code for the amount programmed. If not, it repeats the loop again. "
